Works but is not deployed. Ask The-Code-Whisperer to deploy it and give you the link.

Or clone the repo, install the cs50 library and flask, possibly others.

flask run and you're good to go! Will deploy later for a convenient website link and then these three first README.md lines can be deleted and the below would apply instead.

<h2>SnapFood</h2>
Food delivery web app for customers to have food delivered to their address, "operating" in Toronto.

If used in real life it would be a competitor to current services, but the idea of not serving just the delivery but integrating more of the community unlike usual apps like Uber Eats, Zomato, iFood, Deliveroo and so forth.

<h3>The Idea of the Project<h3>
Snapfood is a web-based application that simulate an order in a delivery website.
This idea comes because we love how delivery apps work and its convenience.

<h3>How to Use<h3>
Just enter the website address and follow instructions!
