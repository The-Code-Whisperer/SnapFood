<h2>SnapFood</h2>
Food delivery web app for customers to have food delivered to their address, "operating" in Toronto.

If used in real life it would be a competitor to current services, but the idea of not serving just the delivery but integrating more of the community unlike usual apps like Uber Eats, Zomato, iFood, Deliveroo and so forth.

<h3>The Idea of the Project<h3>
Snapfood is a web-based application that simulate an order in a delivery website.
This idea comes because we love how delivery apps work and its convenience.

<h3>How to Use<h3>
Just enter the website address and follow instructions!
